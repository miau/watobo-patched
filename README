= WATOBO - THE Web Application Toolbox
WATOBO is a security tool for web applications. WATOBO is intended to enable security professionals to perform efficient (semi-automated) web application security audits.

Most important features:
* WATOBO has Session Management capabilities! You can define login scripts as well as logout signatures. So you don’t have to login manually each time you get logged out. 
* WATOBO can perform vulnerability checks out of the box. 
* WATOBO supports Inline De-/Encoding, so you don’t have to copy strings to a transcoder and back again. Just do it inside the request/response window with a simple mouse click. 
* WATOBO has smart filter functions, so you can find and navigate to the most interesting parts of the application easily. 
* WATOBO is written in (FX)Ruby and enables you to easiely define your own checks 
* WATOBO is free software ( licensed under the GNU General Public License Version 2) 
* It’s by siberas ;) 

== Installation
Please install Ruby 1.9.2+ first before you continue.

Note: Ruby 1.8 is no longer supported!

Note: WATOBO will not run under Ruby 1.8 anymore!

Note: Please upgrade Ruby to 1.9.2+, because WATOBO will not run under Ruby 1.8!

Note: Ruby 1.8 is crap, so get rid of it!

... just want to be sure ;)

=== Windows 7/Vista/XP
  gem install watobo
  
=== BackTrack 5
  gem install selenium-webdriver
  gem install watobo

=== Generic Linux (with APT)
* Install Ruby via RVM
* Setting up a build environment for linux
Based on Lyle Johnsons tutorial https://github.com/lylejohnson/fxruby/wiki/Setting-Up-a-Linux-Build-Environment
  apt-get -y install ruby-full
  apt-get -y install install zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libpng12-dev libjpeg62-dev libtiff4-dev
  apt-get -y install zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libpng12-dev libjpeg62-dev libtiff4-dev
  apt-get -y install libx11-dev libglu1-xorg-dev libxcursor-dev libxext-dev libxrandr-dev libxft2-dev
  apt-get -y install g++

* Install the Fox-Toolkit libs
Use version 1.6.44 only. The 1.7 branch is incompatible with fxruby!
You can download it from the fox-tookit homepage http://www.fox-toolkit.org/
  wget http://ftp.fox-toolkit.org/pub/fox-1.6.44.tar.gz
  tar xzvf fox-1.6.44.tar.gz
  cd fox-1.6.44
  ./configure
  make
  make install
  cd .. 

* Install the Gems
First install the selenium-webdriver gem which is necessary on xnix platforms for the browser preview feature of watobo.
  gem install selenium-webdriver
Finally install the watobo gem.
  gem install watobo

== Usage
In your command prompt start WATOBO with the command:
  watobo_gui.rb

After starting WATOBO the interception proxy is listening on localhost:8081.
     
Configure your browser to use WATOBO as its proxy and visit the site you want to audit.

== Tips & Tricks
* On Linux you should use RVM to install Ruby (http://beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/)
* Use FoxyProxy or SwitchProxy to easily change your proxy settings
