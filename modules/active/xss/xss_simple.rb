Cross-site Scripting (XSS) is an attack technique that involves echoing attacker-supplied code into a user's browser instance. 
A browser instance can be a standard web browser client, or a browser object embedded in a software product such as the browser 
within WinAmp, an RSS reader, or an email client. The code itself is usually written in HTML/JavaScript, but may also extend to 
VBScript, ActiveX, Java, Flash, or any other browser-supported technology.

When an attacker gets a user's browser to execute his/her code, the code will run within the security context (or zone) of the 
hosting web site. With this level of privilege, the code has the ability to read, modify and transmit any sensitive data accessible 
by the browser. A Cross-site Scripted user could have his/her account hijacked (cookie theft), their browser redirected to another 
location, or possibly shown fraudulent content delivered by the web site they are visiting. Cross-site Scripting attacks essentially 
compromise the trust relationship between a user and the web site. Applications utilizing browser object instances which load content 
from the file system may execute code under the local machine zone allowing for system compromise.
